        Since most of you looking at this are strangers, and my mom told me not to talk to strangers, I won't tell you any stories of my personal life, but I'll tell you about how I got into programming :) <br> Okay, so back in March 2019, I was in my sophomore year at the Community College of Rhode Island, taking some accounting classes. But then I realized accounting was BORING, so I wanted to try out the dental hygienist program at CCRI. I was excited because I assumed this was going to be what I was going to do for my life, but then I realized I had to have a 3.4 GPA or something like that, and at CCRI I had a 2.5. <br> The day after I realized I wasn't going to practice medicine and spend a career in people's nasty mouths (which I thank whoever the higher power is for everyday, looking back at it), I asked my homie who's a CS major where I can practice some computer science stuff to see if I liked it. Unnamed homie told me to try out CodeCademy, a website that teaches people how to program. I started it, and liked it a lot. i was learning how to use Java and Python, but just a few weeks ago I started teaching myself how to program with C#. At school I'm learning website design, which is going to be a great side hustle, while at home I'm teaching myself about C#. I still think I'm trash at coding, but an experienced programmer told me that everyone's code is terrible, which made me feel better about myself. <br> I am looking forward to learning more and more about the craft as I pursue my degree. It's my junior year of college, but since I'm in big boy college now instead of CCRI, I'll be challenged more. I'll see how it goes this year. My goal is to score an computer science internship by the beginning of next summer. If you read all of this, I hope you have an amazing day. If you did not read all of this, I hope you have an amazing day, too, I mean, I wish you could read this and feel a bit happy on the inside, but you're not reading this anymore. So i'm just talking to myself because of the crippling loneliness I feel. Again. *shrugs* </p>
