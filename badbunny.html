        Bad Bunny is a game where you try to make sure the bunnies do NOT get to the carrot. The carrot is in the middle of the screen, and bunnies come from all 4 sides of the screen to try to get to it. You have to get the bunnies simply by clicking on the bunnies that pop up on the screen before they get to the carrot. If one bunny gets to the carrot, it's game over. The level increases by one every 10 seconds. What makes this game challenging is that by every increase in level, one more bunny spawns on the screen, and the bunnies get faster. You'll see what I mean if you decide to play Bad Bunny. <br> My high score is 35 seconds... why don't you see if you can beat that. </p>
